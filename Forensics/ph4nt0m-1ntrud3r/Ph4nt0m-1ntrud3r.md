## Solving Steps

<div style="text-align: justify"> After downloading the PCAP file and opening it in Wireshark, we're presented with 22 packets. I tried searching up strings like "pico", "picoCTF", and "flag" but no results show up. I also tried following the TCP stream but there wasn't any result other than a random string that looks like base64 encoding (I tried decoding it but it was just random gibberish).</div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Then I had a realization that maybe the flag is in the form of an encoding. So I searched up the string <b>"cgl"</b>, which is the very start of a base64 encoded string beggining with the word "pico". Doing this results in me being directed to the 9th packet in the file.</div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">I then check the remaining packets and turns out they all have a part of the base64 encoded flag. If you combine all of them and decode it, the results are: </div><br>

## Solving Steps

<div style="text-align: justify">This challenge is pretty self explanatory, all you need to do is run the netcat and it'll play a short story about picoCTF in the year 3025. Sometimes it'll display choices you need to make and you can choose them with either a, b, or c. Pick the right choice and the story will move on. At the end of the short story, the flag will be presented. This is basically a sanity check.</div><br>
